# time-callout
An application for setting the time to an arbitrary deadline and let your PC speak out the current time and time to deadline in 10-minute intervals.

### Restrictions
Might only work for Windows PC's and those that have Python 3 installed. 

## Instructions
1. Open *TimeCallout.exe*. 
2. Enter the hours and minutes in strict (HH) format. 
3. Click 'Start'. 
4. Click 'Stop' anytime you may want to arbitrarily shut down the program before the said deadline. Otherwise, the program shuts itself down when the deadline is over. 

## Why did I make this?
Procrastination feeds on you losing focus on your primary goals. This program just helps reinforce it. I don't know fam... i made this half sleepy close to missing a couple of deadlines myself.
